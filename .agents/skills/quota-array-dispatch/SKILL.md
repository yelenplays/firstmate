# quota-array-dispatch

This skill is the single owner of the pace-aware profile-array selection procedure.
`AGENTS.md` section 4 owns the always-loaded intake boundary, load trigger, malformed-config refusal, every-candidate accounting, and strongest-reasoning/tie safety rules.
`harness-adapters` owns harness verification, model/provider discovery, and effort fallback.
`quota-axi` remains data-only and never recommends a route.
Do not add a daemon, opaque composite score, routing wrapper, hard-coded model-specific policy, or producer-side route recommendation.

## Collect facts

Run `quota-axi --json` once per intake and reuse that snapshot for every candidate.
For each candidate, preserve explicit `harness`, `model`, and `provider`; `harness-adapters` owns identity, and model/provider never infer harness:

- task/profile fit and required reasoning class
- raw applicable headroom (`effectivePercentRemaining` or tightest applicable percentage)
- effective pace, signed reserve per window, and worst reserve (`worstReservePercentPoints` or minimum signed reserve)
- whether applicable windows/summary are ahead, or pace is `unknown`
- schema note when pace fields are absent

Stale raw windows are diagnostic, never headroom.
Read all windows named by `boundedBy`, `limitingWindowIds`, `aheadWindowIds`, `behindWindowIds`, `onPaceWindowIds`, and `unknownWindowIds`.

## Pace semantics

`reservePercentPoints = percentRemaining - timeRemainingPercent`.
Negative reserve means usage is ahead of reset pace and creates conservation pressure.
Positive reserve means usage is behind reset pace.
`on_pace` is neutral.
Conservation pressure is present for effective pace status `ahead`, effective pace status is `mixed` and any `aheadWindowIds` remain, or a bounding window is `ahead`.
`unknown` is valid explicit uncertainty from quota-axi, not parser failure or permission to assume health.

## Selection order

Apply only among candidates satisfying required fit and strongest reasoning class.
Never use pace or raw headroom to silently replace that reasoning class.

1. Unresolved relationship or quota: stop and report the tuple and concrete evidence.
2. All-tight: keep strongest reasoning; dispatch inside it or report if blocked.
3. Comparable fit/reasoning: prefer no ahead pressure over pressure, even with higher raw headroom.
4. Among pressured candidates, prefer the least-negative worst applicable reserve.
5. Sustainable candidates: use known pace plus raw headroom.
   Prefer known sustainable evidence over `unknown` when comparable.
   Do not collapse those facts into an opaque composite score.
6. If unresolved pace changes the choice, report uncertainty.
7. Absent pace or older schema: do not crash, fabricate pace, or treat absence as healthy/`on_pace`.
   Compare raw headroom only, state pace is unavailable, and keep safety rules.
8. Genuine ties: stop and report every tied candidate for captain choice.
   Do not select by array order, harness name, or another arbitrary identity ordering.
   Report duplicate concrete profiles as a configuration error.

Name the inspectable facts used for every candidate.
After selecting, check auth only through that tuple's surface; another harness CLI cannot block it.
A blocked credential report must name `harness`, `model`, authentication surface, and concrete failure evidence; never emit a bare `Grok unauthenticated` statement.
Never conclude with an unexplained "best quota" label.
