# Scout outcome and promotion

A completed scout must leave a self-contained report before its scratch worktree can be discarded; read and relay its findings, record the report as the Done artifact, and re-evaluate the queue.
A report may recommend implementation but does not authorize it.
A cross-family reviewer scout, whose data directory holds `cross-review-request`, is collected with `bin/fm-cross-review.sh collect <task-id> <reviewer-id>` before its cleanup, because its family is read from its own record; relay a failing verdict with the reviewed task, not as a separate investigation.
Before treating the investigation or any visual review as complete, load `captain-hold-lifecycle`; teardown enforces that shared completion gate.
When a scout's deliverable is a visual artifact the captain will iterate on, keep it alive and follow the crew-hosted Lavish board contract in `docs/configuration.md` rather than arming or polling the board from firstmate.
When implementation is separately authorized, promote the existing scout through `bin/fm-promote.sh` rather than creating a duplicate task.
The promoted worker must inventory scratch state, return to a clean copy of the task's base (its recorded base branch, else the default branch), carry over only intended fix changes, create the ship branch, and follow the project's selected delivery path while leaving scratch commits and debug edits behind and turning a reproduced bug into the regression test.
