# Shared wake classifier: the common source of truth for captain-relevant status
# tests, declared-external-wait vocabulary, and the working/paused absorb
# classification that makes no-verb signal and stale-pane wakes safe to absorb.
# Sourced by BOTH the always-on watcher
# (bin/fm-watch.sh) and the away-mode daemon (bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh) so the
# overlapping triage policy lives in one place instead of two copies that can
# drift apart.
#
# Most functions are pure, side-effect-free reads of status files: each takes
# what it needs as arguments and touches no globals beyond the optional
# FM_CAPTAIN_RE override. Consumers layer their own dedup/marker state on top (the
# daemon keeps its escalation-digest seen-markers; the watcher keeps its .seen-*
# signatures).
#
# There are two documented exceptions. The absorb classification
# (crew_absorb_class and its working/paused wrappers) is NOT a pure status-file
# read: it reuses bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which may make a bounded no-mistakes call,
# to decide whether a crew that just stopped its turn or went stale is working,
# deliberately paused, or neither. Callers run it ONLY on no-verb signal handling
# and first sighting of a stale hash, never on every wake, so the per-wake triage
# stays cheap. status_open_decisions_incremental (see "incremental (cursor-backed)
# open-decisions fold" below) also writes: it persists a per-status-file byte
# cursor and folded open-set as a side effect, so a per-drain fleet-wide scan
# stays bounded by new appends instead of re-reading each task's whole lifetime
# log every time.

# Free-text tokens (PR ready, checks green, ready in branch, merged) exist only for

# `blocked:` (stuck, firstmate must help) an idle `paused:` pane is EXPECTED, so
# the stale path absorbs it instead of escalating a possible wedge. It is
# deliberately NOT in the captain-relevant set above: a pause is a "stop
# wedge-nagging this idle pane" signal, not work to keep surfacing. This constant

# --- durable keyed decisions ------------------------------------------------
#
# The status stream is an append-only EVENT log. Reading it last-event-wins
# (last_status_line above) cannot represent "an earlier decision is still open
# after a later, unrelated event": a subsequent done/paused/working line silently
# masks a still-open needs-decision. status_open_decisions is the ONE authoritative
# statement of the status-fold contract that fixes this - a needs-decision/blocked
# line OPENS a keyed decision, and only an explicit resolution or a verified
# captain-held backlog transfer referencing that key CLOSES it; a later unrelated
# terminal line never clears an open captain decision.
# Who WRITES the closing line is owned elsewhere: the answering firstmate closes
# at answer time through fm-send's --resolve-key (bin/fm-send.sh header), and a
# worker self-closes only a blocker that cleared without an answer (bin/fm-brief.sh
# rule 6), so closure never depends on a busy worker's discipline.
#
# Decision key grammar (backward-compatible with the existing "<verb>: <note>"
# format): an OPTIONAL "[key=<slug>]" token sits between the verb and the colon,
#   needs-decision [key=api-shape]: <summary>
#   resolved       [key=api-shape]: <how it was decided>
# A line with no token uses the key "default", preserving the historical
# one-open-decision-per-task behavior (a bare "resolved:" closes "default").

# key token before the colon so the leading word is recovered cleanly.

#
# This library is the single owner of the record's WIRE FORM, its field names,

# rendering; it validates through decision_record_validate below rather than
# restating any limit.
#
# A needs-decision or blocked status line MAY carry an authored, machine-readable
# record in front of its prose why, as one brace-delimited block of field=value
# pairs joined by "|":
#
#   needs-decision [key=one-send]: {question=...|consequence=...|recommend=hold
#   |option=hold/Hold|option=send/Send it/destructive|sensitivity=private
#   |safe_preview=...} the existing prose, unchanged, as the why disclosure
#
# (always one physical line; wrapped here only for legibility.)
#
# The block sits AFTER the first colon, so every pre-record parser - the verb
# parser, the key parser, the decision fold, the watcher and the daemon - reads a
# record-carrying line exactly as it reads a prose-only line. A line with no block
# is today's line and stays valid forever; that is what keeps every already
# recorded decision working untouched.
#
# The ceilings are the measured phone budget, not taste: a collapsed notification
# body holds about 80 characters, a decision card question about 52, a
# notification title about 42, and two 44pt action buttons side by side at 320 CSS
# px hold about 16 characters each. A field that overflows its ceiling cannot be

# local mate appends straight into it, and a remote mate's lines are mirrored
# into it verbatim. So without a rule here, any writer could claim a reserved
# key with an unrelated note, take the key over in this fold, and permanently
# block the owner's close - leaving a decision nothing will ever resolve - or
# clear the owner's decision with a bare resolution.
#
# The rule is deliberately generic, so this fold needs no knowledge of any
# particular owner: a reserved key may only be opened or closed by a line whose
# note speaks that namespace's own vocabulary, which its owner states by
# beginning the note with a `<namespace>...:` token. A line failing that is not a
# decision transition at all here and is folded as ordinary status. This is a
# consumer-side rule on purpose - it protects local and remote writers
# identically, and it can never fail a whole delta or wedge a stream the way a
# writer-side rejection would.

# --- incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold ------------------------
#
# status_open_decisions above re-reads and re-folds a status file's ENTIRE
# lifetime on every call, so its cost grows with total log size. A per-drain
# fleet-wide scan using that whole-file function would pay that cost for every
# task on every wake, which grows unbounded as tasks run longer and accumulate
# status history. status_open_decisions_incremental and scan_open_decisions_incremental
# below are the bounded-cost siblings used for that per-drain path: each call
# reads only the bytes appended to a status file since its own last call (a
# persisted per-file byte cursor) and folds just those new lines into a
# persisted running open-set, via the exact same _fm_decision_fold_line rule
# status_open_decisions uses - so the two strategies can never disagree on what
# is open. Cost is bounded by NEW appends since the last drain, not by the
# status file's total lifetime size.
#
# Correctness invariant (unchanged from the whole-file fold): an open decision
# is dropped ONLY by an explicit resolved/captain-held line for its exact key,
# never by cursor advancement, age, or being buried under later appends - the
# persisted open-set carries every still-open key forward across calls
# regardless of how much new unrelated log content has since been folded in.
#
# The cursor format is `version`, `offset`, `ident`, then the folded open set.
# FM_OPEN_DECISIONS_FOLD_VERSION must be bumped whenever
# _fm_decision_fold_line semantics change, so persisted state from an older
# interpretation is discarded and rebuilt from byte 0.
#
# Cursor invalidation is deliberately minimal, matching how status files are
# ACTUALLY used in this repo: every one is created once (`>`) and only ever
# appended to (`>>`) - never replaced, renamed, or rewritten in place. So the
# ways a cursor can go stale are a fold-version mismatch, a shrink (truncated),
# or the file at this path being a different file than before
# (replaced/rotated/recreated), which a changed device+inode makes an O(1) check
# via a single `stat` call - no content hashing, no re-reading the consumed
# prefix. Any signal falls back to a full re-fold of the whole current file from
# byte 0 - byte for byte what status_open_decisions itself would compute - and
# rewrites the cursor from that clean baseline. A same-inode, same-size,
# in-place byte edit is NOT detected; that is a deliberately accepted gap
# because no code path in this repo ever does that to a status file.
#
# The other real failure mode is OUR OWN read failing (a stat/wc/tail I/O
# error), not a malformed writer: every such read here is checked, and on
# failure this reports the already-trusted persisted set unchanged rather than
# risking a silent invalidation that would wipe it - never a bare "empty" as if
# nothing were open.
#
# Not a pure status-file read: this writes/rewrites the sibling cursor file as a
# side effect (state/.<task>.open-decisions-cursor), the library's second
# documented exception to the pure-read rule after crew_absorb_class. The write
# is atomic (temp file + rename), so a crash between calls leaves either the
# prior cursor or the new one, never a partial one. bin/fm-wake-drain.sh calls
# this only after releasing the wake-queue lock, so a hypothetical race between
# two overlapping drains can at worst redo a little folding work twice - never
# drop an open decision - because a losing writer's offset can only ever be
# equal to or behind an already-recorded byte position, and the next call
# re-derives from whatever offset actually landed on disk.
