# Acquire or inspect the per-home firstmate session lock.
#
# Line 1 of state/.lock is the owning session's anchor pid, resolved by
# fm_session_lock_anchor_pid in bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh: the harness (agent)
# process found by walking the shell's ancestry, which lives as long as the
# firstmate session - unlike the transient subshell PID of any one tool call,
# which is dead moments after it is written. For a Claude session that proves a
# trusted session id the anchor is CLAUDE_PID, the model-loop process, so a
# shared transient daemon or a front-end that outlives the session never keeps
# a dead session's lock alive. Line 1 keeps its whole-line pid format because
# every other reader takes the first line as the pid.
#
# The trusted id itself is recorded beside the lock in state/.lock-session, a
# sidecar written only here and only under the claim lock: refreshed on every
# confirmed-own acquisition, including the early already-mine exit that waits
# for the claim lock, removed when the acquiring session proves no trusted id,
# and left byte-identical when it already names that id. A same-session
# confirmation never rewrites line 1 while the recorded pid is alive, because
# bin/fm-startup-network.sh compares that pid across its deferred sweeps; a dead
# recorded pid is reclaimed and rewritten to this session's anchor.
#
# Usage: fm-lock.sh           acquire; exit 1 unless ownership is verified
#        fm-lock.sh status    print holder and liveness; always exits 0.
#                             A held lock is not proof the holder is consuming
#                             wakes. Machine-readable lock fields live on
#                             fm-inbox.sh ready, from the same inspect helper.
