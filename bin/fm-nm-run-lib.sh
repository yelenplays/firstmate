# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting), fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment), and fm-dod-lib.sh
# (the custody check a Gerrit no-mistakes ready report must pass). Crew-state binds
# an EXECUTING run (pending, running, fixing or ci) on the task's branch
# regardless of head (fm_nm_run_is_executing); every other run still needs
# strict branch-and-head identity. Both callers then recognize a provable
# pipeline-owned continuation through fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree below:
# crew-state for an ACTIVE run - parked, or executing with the daemon answered
# down - so a fix round never reads as an older
# failed run, and teardown for a run PARKED at a gate, so cleanup concludes it
# instead of orphaning it. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.

# run at the worktree's own commit while the live run that replaced it validated
# a descendant commit on the same branch).

# Select from a complete `no-mistakes axi` overview with the existing awk
# toolchain. A capped overview requires an optional Python 3 sqlite3 reader
# for a read-only same-branch query of the state database fm_nm_state_db
# locates for the worktree.
# Repo identity is the overview's own top-level `repo:` line, which every axi
# release emits: it is the `working_path` the CLI itself resolved for the
# queried worktree. That is NOT the task worktree path in general - a linked
# git worktree resolves to its main clone's registered path (observed
# 2026-09-22 on v1.79.0: every task copy of a firstmate home reports
# `repo: <home clone>`, and looking the repo up by the task worktree path
# matched no row, so every capped read reported the inventory unreadable).
# The recorded spelling is matched exactly, so an overview without exactly one
# absolute `repo:` line, or with one the inventory does not record, reads as
# unreadable rather than guessed among candidates.
# The reader subprocess is bounded by $4 seconds (default 10), so a contended
# database can never outlast the caller's per-read budget.
# If that reader or inventory is unavailable, report unknown with available
# candidate ids rather than treating the displayed window as complete.
# Structural completeness applies to the whole table; semantic validation
# applies only to the requested branch, after complete identity lookup when
# capped. Branch names are matched exactly without a character whitelist.
# Its rows are ordered by creation time descending (not last update), then id.
# The newest same-branch row is the candidate regardless of outcome: an older
# live run must not hide a newer failure. If the newest is live and another
# same-branch live run exists, neither has exclusive authority: report all
# candidate ids as unknown. A newer live row can replace cancelled history,
# but the caller must fetch its full status BY ID and prove branch/head,
# executing status, or active pipeline custody before using its steps.
# Never reuse another run's gate detail.
# This is a read-only selection, not teardown authorization.
#
# Prints selected|id|status|candidate-ids, unknown|reason, absent (no row
# for this branch, including a consistent empty table), or unavailable

# 0 if the run in captured `axi status` TOON $1 is EXECUTING: in flight and
# actively working (pending, running, fixing, or ci), not parked at a gate.
# Read-only current-state reporting (fm-crew-state.sh) treats an executing run
# on the task's own branch as authoritative REGARDLESS of head: the pipeline
# rebases the branch and commits fix rounds in its own checkout, so a live run's
# head routinely differs from the task worktree's local head, and falling back
# to an older run that matches the local head reads a working crew as failed.
# A run parked at a gate keeps the strict head rule, and no destructive caller
# uses this predicate: teardown stays on fm_nm_head_matches_worktree and the
# ledger rule below.
# This predicate reads the RECORD only; it cannot tell a live run from one whose
# daemon died still saying `running`. The head-free route through it is the
# caller's to license, and fm-crew-state.sh pairs it with an explicit
# daemon-down probe for exactly that reason.
# All four accepted words reach here on BOTH surfaces. The overview table
# fm_nm_select_run validates carries a narrower column
# (pending|running|completed|failed|cancelled, its unknown_status check), but that column is not
# what this predicate reads: the selected-run route re-reads the run by id and
# passes that DETAIL object, whose own vocabulary check admits `fixing` and `ci`
# as live, and the legacy bare-status route passes the same detail shape.
# Dropping them would report a fix round or a ci wait as idle, which is the
# misreport this predicate exists to prevent.

# ONE owner for attribution from the pipeline's own runs ledger, replacing a

# --limit N` listing (plain text, no run id, no quoting, newest-first, columns
# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]"; the `axi` surface has no
# runs-listing subcommand - verified against the installed CLI). Prints the
# status word of the branch's CURRENT run row, or nothing when the ledger
# cannot prove attribution. When optional expected head $4 is supplied, its
# abbreviated commit identity must match the newest row. The branch's NEWEST
# row alone decides; older rows are history and never answer for the present:
#   - newest row's head resolves and matches the worktree (fm_nm_head_matches_worktree):
#     its status word
#   - newest row's head resolves but does not match: nothing (a newer run that
#     is not this worktree's makes every older row stale history)
#   - newest row's head does not resolve in this copy (the pipeline committed
#     its fix round in its own checkout and the task copy never fetched it):
#     recognized ONLY as a provable pipeline-owned continuation of the
#     submitted head, which requires ALL of: the row is ACTIVE (status
#     running), and the immediately older row for the SAME branch resolves to
#     EXACTLY the worktree HEAD. The pipeline's own ledger then proves an
#     unbroken run sequence from a run that ended at the submitted head to an
#     active run on the same branch - the anchored active row's status word is
#     printed. Anything else (no anchor row, an anchor that is merely an
#     ancestor, a terminal unresolvable row) prints nothing, so branch-name
#     coincidence, arbitrary remote state, and other tasks' runs never match.
# An older live row never displaces a newer terminal result.
# There is no branch-name-only acceptance here: a live row whose head this copy
# cannot tie to the worktree is not this worktree's run just because the branch
# name matches. The one live bind is the EXECUTING record on the `axi status`
# route (fm_nm_run_is_executing above), which the caller pairs with its own
# liveness evidence.
# Read-only: git reads resolve objects in place; custody never changes.
