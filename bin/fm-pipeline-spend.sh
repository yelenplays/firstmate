# fm-pipeline-spend.sh - attribute a task's no-mistakes pipeline spend to the
# task and keep it in Firstmate's own records.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-pipeline-spend.sh record <task-id>
#
# record appends the task's pipeline spend as one JSON object on one line of
# data/pipeline-spend.jsonl, at most once per task incarnation (task id plus
# the record's spawn_gen): repeating it for an incarnation already in the
# ledger appends nothing, so a retried cleanup never counts a task twice.
# Recording is disabled unless config/pipeline-spend is present; in that case
# this command exits before reading task metadata, no-mistakes state, or ledger.
# When enabled, bin/fm-teardown.sh calls record for every ship task whose
# local copy it cleans up, before it deletes the task branch this script
# attributes runs by and before it removes state/<id>.meta. The ledger is
# private and gitignored with the rest of data/.
# Exit status: 0 when a record was recorded or already present, its source is
# unavailable, or recording is disabled; 1 when the task record is missing,
# names a secondmate, or the record could not be built or written; 2 for bad usage.
#
# Source. no-mistakes keeps each agent invocation's token usage only in its
# local state database, one agent_invocations row per invocation; its
# environment reference documents those fields, and `no-mistakes stats --run
# <id>` renders the same rows as a human table. There is no machine-readable
# export yet, so this script reads the database read-only (mode=ro), located
# by bin/fm-nm-run-lib.sh's fm_nm_state_db, and bounded by 30 seconds per
# no-mistakes or database call.
#
# Attribution. A task's runs are the runs no-mistakes recorded for the task
# copy's repository and current branch since that branch was created:
#   - repository: the `repo:` line `no-mistakes axi` prints from the task copy,
#     which is the CLI's own resolution (a pooled worker copy resolves to the
#     registered primary clone), matched exactly against repos.working_path;
#   - branch: the task copy's current branch, the one bin/fm-crew-state.sh
#     reads;
#   - since: the oldest surviving reflog entry of that branch. spawn_gen cannot
#     bound the task, because a relaunch mints a new one while the same branch
#     keeps validating. Teardown deletes the branch, so a later task that
#     reuses the id and branch name starts a fresh reflog and never inherits an
#     earlier task's runs. With no reflog, every run on the branch counts and
#     since is null.
# Two live tasks sharing one branch name in one repository would both count
# its runs; each record lists run ids, so such an overlap stays visible.
#
# Counting. Every invocation of those runs counts, whatever its exit status
# (ok, error, cancelled), and each token field is no-mistakes' own, summed
# without reinterpretation (whether input includes cache reads differs by
# agent; see no-mistakes' environment reference):
#   - input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_tokens sum the per-round
#     delta_* columns, because a resumed session's raw counters are cumulative
#     for some agents (codex) and summing them would count earlier review
#     rounds again. A row with no delta (written before the delta columns
#     existed) falls back to its raw counter only when its session_mode is not
#     `resumed`, since no-mistakes defines a cold, started, or fallback row's
#     delta as its raw counter.
#   - cache_creation_tokens sums the raw counter, which has no per-round
#     delta, so it counts only for a row whose counters are proven
#     per-invocation: not resumed, or every delta equal to its raw counter.
#   - reasoning is not summed: no-mistakes counts it inside output and keeps no
#     per-round delta for it.
# A value no-mistakes did not record is unknown, never zero: each token field
# carries its known total and how many invocations were unknown, so a total
# with unknown > 0 is a lower bound.
#
# Record schema (this header is its one owner). One JSON object:
#   task, spawn_gen         the task id and the incarnation recorded in its meta
#   recorded_at             UTC time the record was built
#   source                  "no-mistakes-state", or "unavailable" when the runs
#                           could not be read; reason then says why, total
#                           is null, and runs and purposes are empty
#   repo, branch, since     the attribution above (since as UTC time or null)
#   total                   a tally over every counted invocation
#   runs[]                  {id, status, created_at} plus a tally, oldest first
#   purposes[]              {purpose} plus a tally, by no-mistakes' purpose
#                           name (review, review-fix, test, document, ci, ...)
# A tally is {invocations, exit: {<exit status>: count}, duration_ms,
# input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_tokens, cache_creation_tokens}, and
# each token field is {total, unknown}.
