# Static watcher program for a validated pull request, merge request, or Gerrit
# change poll sidecar.
# It emits exactly one merged line for a merged change and stays silent
# otherwise, including on every error, so a failed lookup can never be read as
# a merge. The provider-tagged identity is data in the sidecar and is never
# interpolated into this source: these bytes are identical for every task.
# Each provider is read through its own standard CLI, gh for GitHub, glab for
# GitLab, and gerrit-axi for Gerrit, so an upstream checkout needs no extra
# tooling to follow the first two. The Gerrit branch additionally needs jq,
# which bin/fm-pr-check.sh refuses to arm a Gerrit watch without.
