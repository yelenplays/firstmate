# Resolve a project's REGISTERED delivery posture from the data/projects.md registry.
# Default usage prints two words to stdout: "<mode> <yolo>" where mode is one of
# no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only and yolo is on|off.
# --branch-prefix instead prints one value: the project's registered ship-branch
# prefix, "fm/" when the project registers none, is unregistered, or the registry
# is absent, so every existing installation keeps its current "fm/<task-id>"
# branch names unchanged.
# With --forge it prints one word instead: the project's registered forge,
# none|gerrit. The forge is asked for explicitly, so the default output stays
# the same two words for every project, bound or not.
#
# MECHANICAL CONSUMERS ONLY. This answers "what posture did the captain register
# for this project", never "how does this task ship". A task's delivery mode,
# yolo, and ship-branch prefix are resolved by firstmate at intake and passed
# explicitly to bin/fm-brief.sh, bin/fm-spawn.sh, and bin/fm-promote.sh (AGENTS.md
# section 7; bin/fm-brief.sh's own header owns the --branch-prefix flag it accepts).
# The consumers are bin/fm-fleet-sync.sh (skip local-only clones),
# bin/fm-home-seed.sh and bin/fm-remote-home-seed.sh (refuse local-only seeding,
# run no-mistakes init), bin/fm-spawn.sh's advisory registry-deviation notice,
# and --forge for bin/fm-spawn.sh's forge agreement and yolo refusal and for
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which takes the forge binding from here because it is a
# project fact rather than a task choice.
#
# Registry line format (data/projects.md):
#   - <name> - <desc> (added <date>)                                 -> no-mistakes off fm/  (legacy default)
#   - <name> [<mode>] - <desc> (added <date>)                        -> <mode> off fm/
#   - <name> [<mode> +yolo] - <desc> (added <date>)                  -> <mode> on fm/
#   - <name> [<mode> +yolo branch=<prefix>] - <desc> (added <date>)  -> <mode> <yolo> <prefix>
#   - <name> [<mode> forge=gerrit] - <desc> (added <date>)           -> <mode> off, --forge gerrit
#   <name> may contain spaces; it ends at the literal " [" or " - " that follows it.
#   Bracket tokens are order-independent: +yolo, branch=<prefix>, and forge=<value>
#   are recognized by their own shape wherever they appear, and whichever token is
#   left over is the mode. <prefix> must not contain a space; an empty override
#   ("branch=") resolves to "" for a bare "<task-id>" ship branch instead of the
#   legacy "fm/<task-id>".
#
# Registered modes:
#   no-mistakes            full pipeline -> PR -> configured merge authority (default)
#   direct-PR              push + PR via gh-axi, no pipeline
#   local-only             local branch, no remote/PR, guarded local merge
#   no-mistakes-prod-only  a conditional policy, not a task mode: firstmate
#                          classifies each task's surface at intake (the
#                          project-management skill owns that classification).
#                          Mechanical output maps it to its most rigorous leg,
#                          no-mistakes, so sync, seeding, and init treat such a
#                          project as the remote-backed pipeline project it is.
# yolo (orthogonal) = merge authority only: when on, firstmate merges green,
#   in-scope work itself (AGENTS.md section 7).
# branch=<prefix> (orthogonal) = overrides the "fm/" ship-branch prefix so a
#   project's branch and PR do not read as firstmate-authored, e.g. for a
#   third-party repo that does not use this tooling. Query it with
#   --branch-prefix; it never appears in the default "<mode> <yolo>" output, so
#   existing mechanical callers are unaffected by its presence.
# forge (orthogonal, and orthogonal to yolo too) = which forge the project's
#   remote actually is, never inferred from mode, remote name, host, or protocol.
#   `none` means a forge whose pull requests and checks no-mistakes already
#   drives, and `gerrit` means a Gerrit server: no pull requests, so the worker
#   publishes a change with gerrit-axi instead (bin/fm-dod-lib.sh owns what that
#   changes for a worker in each publishing mode).
#   The binding is EXPLICIT because a provider family must never be guessed;
#   bin/fm-forge-detect.sh proposes it from a protocol fact at project-add
#   intake, and the captain's confirmation is what this record holds.
#   A forge describes what a mode publishes, so it composes with no-mistakes and
#   direct-PR and is REFUSED on local-only, which publishes nothing: that mode
#   lands by fast-forwarding local main, which on a review-server project
#   advances it with content the server has never seen
#   (docs/gerrit-forge-integration.md section 3).
#
# A registered `forge=gerrit` project reports yolo=off with an explicit stderr
# refusal, on the captain's decision of 2026-09-15: a Gerrit Code-Review+2 is a
# positive attributed claim that a named human approved, read by colleagues and
# by any audit, and firstmate must not manufacture one.
#
# --raw prints the registered mode annotation unmapped, so a caller that must
# tell a conditional policy apart from a flat mode sees "no-mistakes-prod-only"
# itself. Not combined with --branch-prefix, which has no conditional-policy leg.
#
# An unknown/missing project or unknown mode falls back to "no-mistakes off" (or
# "fm/" under --branch-prefix) and warns to stderr, so a typo never silently
# drops the gate. Other annotation tokens are ignored, as they always were, keyed
# ones included: a `<key>=<value>` token whose key is neither exactly `forge` nor
# `branch` resolves as it did before the forge existed, and in the mode slot it
# is read as an unknown mode. A key one or two edits from `forge` (such as
# `forg=` or `Forge=`) is still ignored, with one stderr warning naming the token
# and the forge=gerrit spelling. The one refusal is a malformed forge binding - a
# `forge=` token whose value is empty or outside the closed set - which is
# REFUSED in the default and --forge output forms: nothing on stdout, exit
# status 3, the token named. Resolving it to "no registered forge" would hand a
# Gerrit project the pull-request contract the binding exists to prevent.
# local-only with a forge is refused the same way. --branch-prefix does not make
# that check: it answers only the registered prefix, and a prefix is orthogonal
# to the forge binding, so it prints even when the forge token is malformed;
# every path that reads the forge binding (default, --forge, and spawn's
# forge-agreement check) still refuses.
