# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared "supervision missing" predicate.
# Usage: . bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh
#
# Reports whether a firstmate home needs supervision because it has in-flight
# work (a state/<id>.meta exists) or an X-mode relay poll
# (state/x-watch.check.sh), and whether its watcher has a fresh liveness beacon
# (state/.last-watcher-beat, touched every poll cycle, within the grace window).
# bin/fm-guard.sh and bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh both gate on FM_SUP_NEEDED, so a
# relay-armed home with no in-flight task is supervised exactly like one with
# work in flight, on every primary harness. bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh uses the
# status fields here for its banner but performs its end-of-turn block decision
# with the live watcher lock check in bin/fm-wake-lib.sh.
# fm_supervision_unhealthy below stays deliberately task-only; it is the narrow
# in-flight predicate, not the supervision-need predicate.
