# Turn-end guard for any firstmate PRIMARY session: the main home OR a
# secondmate's own home. A secondmate runs its own primary firstmate session and
# is guarded exactly like the main primary; only child crew/scout worktrees are
# exempt (see the scoping block below and docs/turnend-guard.md).
#
# fm-guard.sh (bin/fm-guard.sh) is pull-based: it only warns when some other
# supervision script happens to run. A primary session that ends a turn without
# resuming its harness supervision protocol, and then never runs another
# fleet-touching command itself, can sit blind for hours.
# This script is push-based: verified harness turn-end hooks invoke it every time
# the primary is about to end a turn.
# Claude and codex can block directly by preserving exit status 2 and stderr.
# OpenCode and pi adapters use the same predicate and force one bounded
# follow-up because their turn-end events are passive. Grok delegates native
# blocking when its running Stop payload advertises that capability, with one
# bounded resume fallback for payloads from pre-native processes.
# See docs/turnend-guard.md for the per-harness mechanics, validation evidence,
# and fail-open tradeoffs.
#
# Ships with TRACKED harness hook files at the repo root, so this file is
# checked out into every worktree of this repo: the primary checkout, every
# secondmate home (treehouse-leased or git-cloned), and any crewmate/scout task
# worktree spawned to work on firstmate itself (the recursive "firstmate
# improving itself" case). A secondmate home runs its OWN primary firstmate
# session, so it must be guarded like the main primary; only child crew/scout
# worktrees are exempt. It must therefore scope itself at runtime to a real
# primary checkout - the main home or a genuinely marked secondmate home - and
# stay a silent, fast no-op inside child task worktrees.
#
# Loop-guard, codex/Grok (default) mode: never block twice in the same turn.
# Codex uses stop_hook_active and Grok uses stopHookActive; typed camel-case
# takes precedence when both spellings are present. A true value means the
# current stop attempt already follows a block, so this guard always allows it.
# Passive harness adapters provide their own one-follow-up guard before calling
# this script.
# That bounds those harnesses to at most one forced continuation per turn -
# never a wedged, un-endable session - while still nagging again on a later turn
# if the problem persists.
#
# Loop-guard, --claude mode (Stop-owned auto-arm cooperation): Claude Code
# marks EVERY stop after ANY stop-hook-driven continuation stop_hook_active=true,
# including turns started by the asyncRewake auto-arm, so the one-shot allow
# would re-open the exact blind window this guard exists to close
# (docs/turnend-guard.md records the 2026-07-21 incident). In --claude mode this
# guard ignores stop_hook_active and instead cooperates with the Stop-owned
# auto-arm (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), which fires on the same Stop event:
#   1. a live identity-matched watcher with a fresh beacon allows immediately;
#   2. otherwise wait briefly (FM_CLAUDE_AUTOARM_SYNC_WAIT_MS, default 800ms)
#      for the auto-arm to claim this home (state/.claude-autoarm.lock owner
#      alive) or to record a fresh rewake outcome (state/.claude-autoarm-epoch)
#      for this event epoch - either proof allows without consuming a
#      continuation, so one event epoch yields exactly one recovery turn;
#   3. only when neither materializes is the auto-arm genuinely absent: re-block
#      with the repair banner, bounded to FM_CLAUDE_TURNEND_BLOCK_BUDGET
#      (default 3) consecutive blocks per session - safely below Claude Code's
#      hard 8-consecutive-block override - then allow degraded with a visible
#      systemMessage so the session can always end.
# Any allow resets the consecutive-block budget.

# --- scope precisely to a PRIMARY checkout ----------------------------------
# A genuinely-marked secondmate home runs its OWN primary firstmate session, so
# force-INCLUDE it as a guarded primary whether treehouse leased it as a linked
# worktree (git-dir != git-common-dir) or it is a git-cloned plain checkout. This
# mirrors the cd-guard's intent that a secondmate's own session is a guarded
# primary. Only an UNMARKED checkout (or one with an invalid marker) falls
# through to the linked-worktree exemption: firstmate hands out crewmate/scout
# task worktrees as genuine linked `git worktree`s (bin/fm-spawn.sh aborts
# otherwise), whose git-dir lives under the parent repo's .git/worktrees/<name>
# and differs from the common (shared) git-dir, while a main, non-worktree
# checkout has the two equal. Child worktrees never carry the gitignored marker,
# so this exempts them while guarding every real secondmate home.
