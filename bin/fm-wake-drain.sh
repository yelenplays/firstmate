# only when a guarded supervision script (fm-peek/fm-send/...) happens to run.
# Reuse fm-guard.sh's model-aware alarm and FM_GUARD_GRACE instead of duplicating
# its supervision verdict. Under Claude's between-turns auto-arm model, a normal
# fire leaves a recent beacon well inside grace and stays silent mid-turn. Under
# persistent-watcher models, the guard also requires the live identity-matched
# watcher. Call after the queue is emptied so guard never re-prints its own
# queued-wakes notice for the records this run just drained, and never let a
# guard hiccup change the drain's exit status.

# annotations above, so a decision buried under later unrelated appends cannot
# be silently missed. Runs on every drain - including the empty-queue fast path
# - because the decision can still be open even when nothing new is queued for
# its task this turn. The incremental wrapper bounds this scan's cost to bytes
# appended to each task's status log since the LAST drain, not that log's whole
# lifetime, while still never dropping an old buried decision (see
# fm-classify-lib.sh's "incremental (cursor-backed) open-decisions fold").
