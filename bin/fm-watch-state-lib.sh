#!/usr/bin/env bash
# bin/fm-watch-state-lib.sh - the ONE owner of the watcher pane-supervision
# marker lifecycle under state/.
#
# fm-watch.sh names every per-window bookkeeping file by one derivation
# (fm_watch_state_key): the recorded endpoint target with ':', '/', and '.'
# flattened to '_'. That key outlives the task that created it: a window handed
# to a successor (a reused pane slot, a relaunched endpoint, a remote route
# claimed again) resolves to the NEW task through window_to_task while the OLD
# task's .hash-/.count-/.stale-/.stale-since-/.wedge-escalations- and
# pause/write/wait markers still sit on disk. The first stable-hash sight then
# classifies the successor inside the predecessor's escalation timeline - the
# false "possible wedge, escalation N" alarms on healthy workers that this
# retirement exists to stop (the 2026-09 phantom stale/wedge incidents).
#
# Retirement has two complementary mechanisms, both inside existing lifecycle
# paths - no ad-hoc cleaner:
#
#   bind    fm_watch_window_bind, called by the watcher for every recorded
#           window once at startup and again per poll before any marker is
#           read. The .window-owner-<key> marker records which task the key's
#           state belongs to. Three cases: the recorded owner IS the task -
#           one marker read and return; the recorded owner is another task
#           still live on an endpoint that derives this key - the flattened
#           key space is lossy (sess:a.b and sess:a_b share one key), so a
#           live sharer's marker set is shared state left untouched, not
#           residue; anything else - a dead or moved owner, or no record at
#           all - makes the key foreign residue retired before it can be
#           read, then the new owner is written, except while another live
#           task still shares the key, where only the owner record is
#           re-pointed. Spawn claims the key before it publishes the record,
#           so a task never loses its own live markers to this bind.
#           Detection semantics are unchanged: the successor's own fresh
#           counters still classify, absorb, and escalate exactly as before.
#
#   retire  fm_watch_retire_window_state + fm_watch_retire_task_state, called
#           by bin/fm-teardown.sh when a task's endpoint goes away and by
#           bin/fm-spawn.sh just before it publishes a task record claiming an
#           endpoint. The task retire also removes the per-incarnation turn
#           anchors (<task>.turn-ended, <task>.progress, and the turn-end seen
#           marker) so a relaunched incarnation's turn-age clock starts from
#           its own record, never a predecessor's stale mtime - a stale anchor
#           reads as already over the completed-turn bound and skips the wedge
#           hold on the new incarnation's first silent step.
#           fm_watch_orphan_state_sweep, called by bin/fm-bootstrap.sh
#          's locked session-start mutating phase after backlog reconciliation
#           settles the live meta set, removes whatever those paths could not:
#           window-keyed markers whose key no live meta records, task-keyed
#           markers whose task has no meta, signal files whose task is gone,
#           and seen markers whose signal file is gone.
#
# The status-paired marker families (.seen-<task>_status, .hb-surfaced-<task>,
# .subsuper-seen-status-<task>, .<task>.open-decisions-cursor) stay owned by
# status_retire_presentation_task (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), which removes them
# together with <task>.status - a deliberately kept orphan log keeps its
# markers so it can never replay. The sweep removes one of those markers only
# when its <task>.status is gone.
#
# Requires fm-backend.sh sourced (fm_meta_get, fm_backend_target_of_meta);
# every production caller already has it.
