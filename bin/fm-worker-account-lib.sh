# fm-worker-account-lib.sh - the single owner of the opt-in per-home worker
# account pin: which runners can be pinned, how a pin file is parsed and
# resolved, the launch-time sign-in check under it, and the environment
# credentials a pinned Claude launch sheds.
#
# docs/configuration.md "Worker account pin" owns the operator-facing contract.
# Sourced by bin/fm-spawn.sh and bin/fm-control.sh.
#
# Pinnable runners, each a credential store inside a root its vendor lets a
# process select:
#   claude          CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR     config/claude-account
#   pi, pi-signed   PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR   config/pi-account
#
# The pin is opt-in: an absent file is no pin, and the launch keeps today's
# ambient behavior byte for byte. A present file must resolve, or the launch
# refuses; nothing falls back to an ambient or vendor-default login once a
# home has declared one. `ordinary` selects the vendor default: for Claude
# that is CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR unset, because Claude reads $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/
# .claude.json and keys its macOS Keychain entry to any CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR that
# is set, even $HOME/.claude; for Pi it is $HOME/.pi/agent. Any other value is
# one absolute path to an existing readable, searchable directory. Firstmate
# never copies credentials or changes a global login.
#
# A Pi root can hold several provider identities, so config/pi-account names
# the root on line 1 and the providers that home may spend on line 2,
# separated by spaces. A pinned Pi launch must name its provider explicitly as
# --model <provider>/<id>, and that provider must be declared; Firstmate never
# guesses a provider for an unqualified model. The canonical launch also
# passes --provider <that provider>, because without it Pi may resolve a
# provider-prefixed model under another authenticated provider. A raw Pi
# launch command is launched verbatim and cannot receive that flag, so a home
# with config/pi-account refuses raw Pi launches. A raw Claude launch command
# runs after the pinned root and shed credentials are applied, so its own
# leading CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or shed-credential assignment would override the
# pin; a home with config/claude-account refuses such a command.
#
# The sign-in check asks the runner itself, with only HOME, PATH, TMPDIR,
# USER, LOGNAME, and the selected root in its environment, so a credential
# variable left in the caller cannot answer for a root that has no login:
#   Claude: `claude auth status`, which exits 0 only when signed in.
#   Pi:     `pi auth check --provider <p> --json --no-refresh`; status "ready"
#           passes. `pi auth check` loads no extensions, so it answers
#           not_ready/provider_not_found for an extension-registered provider,
#           and a Pi without the command (before 0.84.1) prints no JSON. Both
#           fall through to `pi --list-models <p>`, which lists only the models
#           a root can authenticate; a row whose provider column is exactly
#           <p> passes. --no-refresh keeps the check from rewriting a root's
#           tokens while other workers use them.
# A pinned Claude launch also unsets the environment credentials Claude ranks
# above the root's stored login, so an ambient API key or token cannot outrank
# the pin. Pi ranks a root's stored credentials above environment variables,
# and the check refuses a provider the root has not stored, so a pinned Pi
# launch unsets nothing.
