# Startup-memory `/stow` verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record supports the active bounded-memory and whole-file curation guarantees for Firstmate's internal `/stow` skill.
[`docs/configuration.md`](../configuration.md) owns the current operator-facing setting and estimate.
The internal skill owns curation and completion-receipt behavior.
Task chronology, fixture paths, and delivery evidence remain outside this record.

## Synthetic real-agent pass

The development-only real-agent pass ran on 2026-07-30 with Pi 0.82.0 on `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-terra` at medium thinking.
It used disposable primary and secondmate-shaped `FM_HOME` directories under the repository worktree only.
No live Firstmate memory, project data, credential content, or external system was placed in either fixture or prompt.
The following exact Bash shell body created the sanitized fixtures, invoked the model-qualified skill twice per home, and captured reports, hashes, and file modes:

```bash
set -eu
VERIFY_ROOT=$(mktemp -d "$PWD/.stow-verification.XXXXXX")
RUNTIME_ROOT="$VERIFY_ROOT/runtime-root"
PRIMARY="$VERIFY_ROOT/primary"
SECONDMATE="$VERIFY_ROOT/secondmate"

}

## Current preferences

- Prefer the simplest direct end-to-end operational path.
- Preserve unique current facts when compacting memory.
- Use plain dashes in prose.

## Duplicate and superseded material

- Prefer the simplest direct end-to-end operational path.
- Old policy: build a wrapper before every one-off operation.
- Old policy copy: always build a wrapper for one-off work.
- Stale tool path: `/opt/old-firstmate/bin/fm`.
- Stale release version: 0.41.0.
- Completed task: migrated the demo fixture on Monday.
- Completed task detail: checked the demo fixture again on Tuesday.
- Metric from the completed task: 47 records moved.

# Shared captain preferences

This file is main-authoritative in the main firstmate home.
In secondmate homes it is read-only in secondmate homes and must not be edited there.
Route new captain-preference discoveries to the main firstmate through marked status or a document pointer.

- Never expose secrets or weaken an accepted safety boundary.
- Prefer the simplest direct end-to-end operational path.
- Superseded policy: secondmates may rewrite shared memory when convenient.
- Duplicate safety note: do not expose secrets.

# Learnings

- Stable fact: startup-memory configuration is documented in `docs/configuration.md`.
- Authoritative pointer: incident detail belongs in `data/reports/synthetic-incident.md`.
- Stable fact copy: consult `docs/configuration.md` for startup-memory configuration.
- Completed chronology: first the synthetic incident was detected, then triaged, then assigned.
- Completed chronology continued: a patch was drafted, reviewed, merged, and announced.
- Old metric: the discarded prototype used 812 estimated tokens.
- Stale path: the discarded prototype lived at `/tmp/old-memory-prototype`.
- Superseded alternative: maintain both a JSON memory database and Markdown files.
- Report-sized procedure: create a staging directory, enumerate every file, copy each file, compare every line, write a status ledger, notify all operators, archive the ledger, and repeat the entire sequence after every prompt.

- Unique current learning: inherited shared memory counts against the local total.
- Authoritative pointer: startup-memory behavior is documented in `docs/configuration.md`.
- Duplicate learning: include inherited shared memory in the local total.
- Stale path: `/tmp/secondmate-memory-v1`.

- Completed chronology: opened the sample, measured it, discussed it, revised it, remeasured it, and closed it.
- Old metric: the sample once measured 604 estimated tokens.
- Report-sized procedure: take a snapshot, copy it to a ledger, annotate every old measurement, preserve every discarded alternative, append a timestamp, and repeat after each completed task.

```

The first pass preserved current preferences, shared-memory and safety authority, a stable operating fact, and authoritative configuration and incident-report pointers while removing duplicate, superseded, stale, and chronological material.
The secondmate fixture passed the production home validator before the existing inheritance owner installed the main-authoritative file read-only.
Both secondmate passes preserved its unique local preference and learning while leaving those inherited bytes and mode untouched.
This verifies the real instruction path consolidates to budget, reports truthful deltas, preserves the primary-owned shared boundary, and does not grow on an identical second pass.
