## Native session-start delivery

The cross-harness transport pass ran on 2026-07-17 with Codex 0.144.4, Grok 0.2.103, OpenCode 1.17.18, Pi 0.80.10, and the tracked Claude hook wiring.

Codex command shape:

```sh
codex exec --ephemeral --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message last.txt \
  'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.'
```

Observed result: the `SessionStart` hook completed and its stdout reached model context.

Grok command shape:

```sh
grok --trust -p 'Follow any SessionStart hook context before this prompt.' \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions --output-format plain
```

Observed result: the project hook ran, but its stdout did not reach model context.
This is the current Grok fail-open limit.

OpenCode was checked in both headless and interactive modes.
`client.session.promptAsync` accepted the nudge in both cases; the persistent TUI completed the generated turn, while `opencode run` exited before another turn.
This is the current headless fail-open limit.

Pi command shape:

```sh
pi -p -e .pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts \
  --no-context-files --no-session \
  'After obeying any earlier session-start instruction, reply with exactly PI_SMOKE_DONE.'
```

Observed result: `PI_SMOKE_DONE`, with one session-start execution.
The earlier `sendUserMessage` counterfactual raced the positional prompt; the current non-triggering `pi.sendMessage` custom message did not.

Current deterministic and live entry points:

```sh
tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh
tests/fm-captain-translation-contract.test.sh
FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The Ahoy first-message boundary was reverified on 2026-07-22 with Pi 0.81.1 and OpenCode 1.17.18.
Marked current operational input and the two exact legacy compatibility shapes selected Bearings, while genuine near-miss captain messages remained real boundaries.
The detailed reconciliation and task chronology stay in the private audit report and PR evidence.

## Turn-end guard

The direct and passive mechanisms were validated across all five harnesses on 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-12, with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24.

| Harness | Version verified | Mechanism | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | 2.1.219 | Cooperative blocking `Stop` guard plus `asyncRewake` auto-arm | A fresh unsupervised session ran session start first, reclaimed a stale dead-owner lock, completed two tokenless rewake cycles with no model arm command or guard continuation, and left a competing live owner unchanged. |
| Codex | 0.142.1 | Blocking `Stop` hook | Hook process root stayed anchored to the trusted checkout and one continuation ran. |
| OpenCode | 1.17.6 | Passive `session.idle` callback | Throwing could not block, while `promptAsync` scheduled one TUI follow-up; headless remained fail-open. |
| Pi | 0.80.5 | Passive `agent_settled` callback | Exactly one guard follow-up ran for an unhealthy cycle, with no recursion across tool turns. |
| Grok | 0.2.93 | Passive `Stop` plus bounded resume | Project hook ran under trust, resumed once without inherited bypass permissions, and the environment latch prevented recursion. |

The secondmate-home scope and manual-repair wake path were measured with Claude Code 2.1.207 on 2026-07-12, when a native background completion re-invoked the idle model with no human input.
The current Stop-owned main/secondmate inclusion and child-worktree exclusion are covered deterministically by `tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh`.

The Claude product live path ran with Claude Code 2.1.219 on 2026-07-24:

```sh
claude --version
FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.219 (Claude Code)
ok - Claude 2.1.219 (Claude Code) live E2E reclaimed a stale session lock through session start, completed two tokenless Stop-owned rewake cycles, and preserved the competing-live-owner boundary
```

Kimi's global crew hook surface was re-verified on 2026-07-30 with Kimi Code CLI 0.31.0, after a model-configuration refresh reserialized the live config and left the hook table without Firstmate's markers.
The installed binary bundles smol-toml 1.6.1, whose writer emits `key = value` with `JSON.stringify` strings and carries no comments, which is why the markers are lost while the hook table survives byte for byte.
The refresh was reproduced against an isolated fixture home, never the captain's own configuration:

```sh
kimi --version
HOME="$fixture_home" bin/fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh install
# then rewrite the fixture config as Kimi's writer does: same hook table, no comments
HOME="$fixture_home" bin/fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh install
```

Observed version, and the observed pre-fix refusal on that rewritten config:

```text
0.31.0
fm-kimi-turnend-hook: refused: config.toml references fm-turn-end.sh outside the Firstmate-owned region.
```

The same input now installs silently.
The reclaimed config differed from the rewritten one by exactly the two marker lines, the foreign hook table and every blank line survived, a second install changed no byte, and removal restored the surrounding config byte-identically.
`tests/fm-kimi-harness.test.sh` owns the adversarial matrix that must keep refusing without a config write: altered or extra fields, a missing field, wrong field values, duplicate canonical tables, comments inside the table or on its header, an ambiguous table boundary, an inline hook array, and a second reference outside the table.

### Session identity under Claude Code's helper tree

Claude Code 2.1.220 launches a session as a `claude bg-spare` process whose ancestors are a `claude bg-pty-host` and a `claude daemon run` at ppid 1.
All three carry the harness command name, but only the `bg-spare` is the session: it holds the home checkout as its working directory, while the pty host and the daemon are shared by every Claude session on the machine.
The session is therefore normally the NEAREST harness-named ancestor of a hook or tool call it fires, so the pid minted into `state/.lock` is that nearest match.
Widening the mint to an outer harness-named ancestor would reach the shared daemon and record one pid for every Claude session at once, which is why `fm_harness_ancestry_pid` stops at the first match.
Session ownership itself is verified as ancestry membership, so a helper or nested shell interposed below the session cannot disown it.
The 2.1.219 evidence above was collected before this helper tree existed and does not cover it.

Measured with Claude Code 2.1.220 on 2026-07-25:

```sh
claude --version
ps -axo pid,ppid,comm
bash tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
2.1.220 (Claude Code)
89494     1 /opt/homebrew/Caskroom/claude-code@latest/2.1.220/claude
89502 89494 claude bg-pty-host
89533 89502 claude bg-spare
ok - auto-arm: claims its own home when the session sits above the harness's own helper process
ok - auto-arm: a same-harness helper never extends ownership to an unrelated live session's home
ok - fm-lock: a session behind its harness's own helper is never refused its own home
ok - fm-lock: minting stops at the session and never widens to a shared harness ancestor above it
```

The first and third cases fail against the nearest-harness-ancestor equality predicate the ownership change replaced.
The second is the fail-closed control and passes both before and after it.
The fourth is the minting regression guard for the shared-ancestor shape above: it passes here and fails whenever the ancestry walk is widened past the session, recording the shared daemon pid instead.

## Watcher continuity

The cross-harness evidence combines the 2026-07-17 live pass with Claude's replacement Stop-owned path revalidated on 2026-07-24, all against isolated project and home state.
No credential material was copied into a fixture.

```text
Claude Code 2.1.219
codex-cli 0.144.4
OpenCode 1.17.18
Pi 0.80.10
grok 0.2.103 (89c3d36fb6f1) [stable]
```

| Harness | Exact opt-in command | Observed guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` | Session start reclaimed a stale owner before two Stop-owned cycles, and a competing live owner prevented arm, rewake, epoch write, or lock replacement. |
| Codex | `FM_CODEX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-codex-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | The one-second foreground checkpoint returned without switching to the arm wrapper. |
| OpenCode | `FM_OPENCODE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-opencode-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | A verified successor existed before prompt handling, with no model re-arm or turn-end fallback. |
| Pi | `FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` | One initial tool call led to extension-owned successors and clean child retirement on exit. |
| Grok | `FM_GROK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-grok-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` | Native task completion surfaced the actionable close and the cycle ledger recorded `reason=actionable-signal`. |

Pi 0.81.1 repeated the continuity and clean-exit lifecycle on 2026-07-23 after the Calm presentation changes.

## Wedge-alarm channels

The two real notification channels were bounded manually on 2026-07-10 on macOS 26.5.2 with Herdr 0.7.3.
Automated suites never execute these real notification commands.

Argv-safe Notification Center command:

```sh
/usr/bin/osascript \
  -e 'on run argv' \
  -e 'display notification (item 1 of argv) with title "FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE" sound name "Basso"' \
  -e 'end run' \
  'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)'
```

Observed output: no stdout, exit 0, and one banner with the supplied body.

Herdr command:

```sh
herdr notification show 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE' \
  --body 'FIRSTMATE TEST - IGNORE (wedge-alarm channel verification)' \
  --sound request
```

Observed output:

```json
{"id":"cli:notification:show","result":{"reason":"shown","shown":true,"type":"notification_show"}}
```

The safe command-channel contract is covered without a notification by `tests/fm-daemon.test.sh`: the summary reaches both `$1` and stdin, every channel is process-group bounded, and a failed channel falls through.
