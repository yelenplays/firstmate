# Zellij runtime backend

Zellij is an experimental explicit-only session backend.
It provides the terminal session while Treehouse continues to provide task worktrees.
[`configuration.md`](configuration.md#runtime-backend-configbackend--fm_backend) owns shared selection and metadata semantics.

## Setup

Pick Zellij when you already use it as a terminal multiplexer and accept its current focus, liveness, and polling limits.

Prerequisites:

- Zellij 0.44 or newer.
- `jq` for JSON responses.
- The universal harness and toolchain requirements in [`configuration.md`](configuration.md#toolchain).

Select it with local `config/backend` containing `zellij`, `FM_BACKEND=zellij` for one launch, or an explicit request to Firstmate.
It is never auto-detected.
A spawn stops before creating a session or acquiring a worktree when Zellij or `jq` is missing or Zellij is below 0.44.

Firstmate uses one shared session named `firstmate` by default.
`FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` can select another name for isolated verification.
Attach with:

```sh
zellij attach <session-name>
```

Routine supervision does not require attachment.
Use `bin/fm-peek.sh <id>` and `FM_HOME=<home> bin/fm-send.sh <id> '<text>'` against the metadata-routed endpoint.

Verify setup by spawning a small task and confirming metadata contains `backend=zellij`, `zellij_session=`, `zellij_tab_id=`, and `zellij_pane_id=`.

## Task shape and home isolation

Every task receives one tab in the shared Zellij session.
The caller-facing label remains `fm-<id>`, while the visible title is home-scoped as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
The home label is `firstmate` or `2ndmate-<id>` plus a short stable hash of the resolved Firstmate root.
This prevents task-id collisions between a primary, secondmates, and separate Firstmate installations sharing one session.

Zellij does not enforce tab-name uniqueness, so the adapter performs its own duplicate check against the scoped title.
Create, recover, list, and cleanup paths all use the same scoped title owner in `bin/fm-backend-hometag-lib.sh`.
Moving a Firstmate installation changes its path hash and leaves old titles unmatched, consistent with worktree paths also becoming stale after a move.

A pre-home-tag task remains reachable through its recorded metadata only when exactly one live tab has the old unscoped title.
Multiple old tabs with the same title cause a refusal rather than a guess.
Bulk recovery never adopts unscoped legacy tabs because it has no safe home identity for them.

```text
backend=zellij
window=<session>:<pane-id>
zellij_session=<session>
zellij_tab_id=<tab-id>
zellij_pane_id=<pane-id>
```

Recorded pane ids are numeric and are never trusted alone after a session recreation.
Metadata-routed operations also verify the owning tab's expected scoped or unambiguous legacy title.
An explicit raw `session:pane` target remains a pane-existence-only operator escape hatch.

## Current operation and safety

Zellij's CLI action commands return exit 0 even for missing sessions or panes.
The adapter therefore verifies session, terminal pane, and expected title before an operation and validates JSON or integer response shapes afterward.
A pane can still disappear between verification and the operation; downstream submit, worktree-discovery, and stale detection report that narrow race rather than treating exit 0 as success.

Every pane operation passes an explicit `--pane-id` because a new session can focus its release-notes plugin pane, whose numeric plugin id is in a separate namespace from terminal pane ids.

`pane_cwd` follows a top-level shell `cd` but not the foreground subshell opened by `treehouse get`.
Worktree discovery therefore sends begin and end markers around `pwd`, captures the marked block, and joins wrapped path lines.
This active probe is scoped to spawn-time worktree discovery and is not advertised as a general live-cwd API.

`new-tab` has no no-focus flag and temporarily focuses the created tab in attached clients.
The adapter records the previously active tab and immediately restores it with `go-to-tab-by-id`.
There is a narrow visible race between those calls that no current Zellij flag can remove.

Literal send uses bracketed paste followed by a separate explicit Enter.
The adapter supports `Enter`, `Esc`, and the one-argument key expression `Ctrl c` through the shared key vocabulary.
Zellij exposes no cursor-row, ANSI composer style, or native agent-state signal, so submit acknowledgement remains content-delta based.
This can distinguish no change from a changed screen but is less precise than tmux's structural box reader or Herdr's native state plus structural classifier.

Viewport capture has no line-bound option.
Routine reads use `dump-screen` and larger peeks use `dump-screen --full`, followed by local trimming.
A short viewport may expose fewer lines than requested.

Closing a pane leaves an empty tab.
Cleanup resolves and verifies the owning tab, then uses `close-tab-by-id` so both the task pane and tab disappear.
Real test cleanup uses only an isolated non-`firstmate` session and the guard in `tests/zellij-test-safety.sh`; it never calls all-session deletion commands.

## Active limits

- Zellij is experimental and explicit-only.
- All homes share one session and tab bar; scoped titles prevent cross-home identity collisions but do not create per-home visual containers.
- There is no native busy or push-event signal, so supervision uses capture/hash polling for screen changes and each harness adapter's semantic lifecycle for worker state.
  Grok alone retains its isolated rendered-tail fallback.
- There is no verified agent-process liveness signal, so a dead Zellij secondmate is reported inconclusive rather than auto-respawned.
- New-tab focus restoration has a narrow visible race.
- CLI exit status is not meaningful; a target can still disappear after structural readiness checks.
- Worktree cwd discovery requires the spawn-time marker probe.
- An ambiguous unscoped legacy title requires manual cleanup and respawn.

## Regression entry points

```sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij-smoke.test.sh
```

The real smoke test uses a unique session and guarded deletion.
[`verification/runtime-backends.md`](verification/runtime-backends.md#zellij) records the active CLI matrix and lifecycle evidence.
