# Behavior tests for the orphaned chrome-devtools-axi browser bridge sweep.
#
# The leak this pins: chrome-devtools-axi starts its bridge detached, so the
# bridge is a process-group leader reparented to init at once, and it has no
# parent-liveness check. A firstmate task that ends without a farewell signal
# leaves the bridge, its chrome-devtools-mcp children, and their detached
# Chrome tree - plus the Chrome profile directory - running indefinitely.
# Observed 2026-09-21 as six orphaned automation trees, the oldest two days
# and four hours old, with 21 Chrome processes and ~3.6GB of leftover browser
# profiles from completed tasks.
#
# fm_browser_bridge_sweep is a machine-wide sweep by design, so these cases
# assert only about their own fixture processes. Any other bridge tree it
# reaps during the run had a proven-dead owner too, which is exactly the
# contract; anything it cannot positively attribute stays untouched.
#
# Fixture bridges are python stand-ins because only user binaries expose their
# environment through `ps eww` on macOS - SIP-protected binaries like
# /bin/sleep report none, and an unreadable environment is itself one of the
# refusal paths under test.
