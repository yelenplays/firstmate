# tests/fm-classify-corr-token.test.sh - a status line may carry the correlation
# token bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh embeds in a marked request and a secondmate
# echoes back (bin/fm-brief.sh), between the verb and the rest of the line. Every
# verb-driven classification must read straight through that token, in BOTH
# directions: a verb parse that keeps the token glued on matches no arm of the
# decision fold, so the opener never opens, the closer never closes, and a
# decision the captain is owed never reaches him.
#
# The parse is deliberately strict, and these tests defend that strictness as
# hard as they defend the fix: only the exact token a firstmate library writes is
# read through. Prose, a malformed or wrong-length token, and an arbitrary
# name=value word all keep their extra words and therefore stay non-transitions.
#
# Coverage is split by the interface each claim lives behind: the fold is driven
# through the REAL bin/fm-wake-drain.sh, the classifier predicates through the
# library's own sourced entry points (as tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh does), and
# the token grammar itself is pinned against the REAL writers so this library's
# second statement of the shape cannot drift from the one that owns it.
