# The load-bearing contract, task fm-composer-shellglyph-safety:
#   1. A BARE shell prompt glyph (`>`/`$`/`%`/`#`) on an unstructured row is a
#      dead shell, NOT an empty agent composer - it must read `unknown`
#      (unsafe-for-injection), never `empty`. This is the safety fix.
#   2. The SAME shell glyph INSIDE a bordered composer box is the harness's own
#      prompt and still reads `empty` (existing behavior preserved).
#   3. The AGENT prompt glyphs `❯` (claude), `›` (codex), `⟩` (muse), and `→`
#      (cursor) are a genuine empty agent composer either way, bordered or bare.
#   4. Real unsubmitted text reads `pending`; a known idle placeholder reads
#      `empty`.
