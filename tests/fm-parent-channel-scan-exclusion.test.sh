# tests/fm-parent-channel-scan-exclusion.test.sh - a remote mate home's own
# outbound parent channel (state/parent-replies.status, resolved through
# bin/fm-parent-channel-lib.sh) must not be enumerated by the home's own status
# scans: every parent-channel append is mirrored into the parent home by the
# remote reply adapter, so folding or waking on it here spins spurious signal
# wakes and phantom "parent-replies" open decisions. The exclusion must be
# home-shape-aware: a parent-replies.status in a main home, in a local mate, or
# in any other home shape is an ordinary task log and keeps waking and folding.
#
# Covers the watcher scan (scan_signals, the heartbeat fail-safe backstop), the
# away-mode daemon's twin catch-all scan (fm-supervise-daemon.sh housekeeping),
# and fm-classify-lib.sh's fleet-wide folds (whole-file, incremental,
# presentation snapshot, unread surface), each against a real remote mate
# fixture plus the main-home and local-mate negative cases, and the real
# fm-wake-drain.sh end to end.
