# Behavior tests for bin/fm-remote-delta-read.sh, the append-only reply-log
# reader a remote lane runs as its preemptible long poll.
#
# Pins, through the executable interface:
#   * the delta schema: offsets, prefix and payload hashes, and payload bytes
#   * every continuity-break reason: truncated, prefix-changed, missing, and
#     line-exceeds-bound, plus an unsafe symlink or traversal target
#   * an incomplete tail line is withheld until a newline completes it
#   * exit 75 when the wait window closes with nothing appended
#   * the per-poll executable boundary: an unchanged log costs one stat per
#     sample, and the bounded capture/hashing path runs only when the file's
#     stat identity changed - a same-size in-place rewrite still breaks the
#     continuity hash, so statting cheaper never hides a change.
