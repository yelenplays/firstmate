# tests/fm-spawn-orca-worktree.test.sh - regression coverage for the
# backend=orca carve-outs in bin/fm-spawn.sh's worktree-entry proof (#4991,
# bacadc4).
#
# spawn_current_path (bin/fm-spawn.sh) has no `orca` case, because Orca hands
# back a terminal that is already bound to the worktree it just created -
# there is no shared pane whose cwd firstmate must poll for. Without an
# explicit skip, spawn_assert_agent_worktree's post-launch proof would poll
# spawn_current_path in a loop, read nothing but empty output every time, and
# hard-refuse EVERY Orca launch once its 20-read deadline elapsed. This test
# spawns a real (fake-Orca-backed) task and asserts it succeeds and records
# the worktree Orca actually created, proving the skip does not just avoid an
# error but lets a genuine Orca launch complete.
#
# The matching relaunch-side carve-out at the `[ "$RELAUNCH" -eq 1 ] &&
# [ "$BACKEND" = orca ]` branch is guarded by an earlier, unconditional gate:
# fm_control_backend_state_verified (bin/fm-control-lib.sh) only recognizes
# tmux and herdr as having a recovery-grade agent-state classifier, so any
# `--relaunch` on backend=orca is refused before that branch can ever run.
# The second test below pins that refusal so a future change that starts
# routing orca through the classifier does not silently reach the untested
# branch without also covering it.
