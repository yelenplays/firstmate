# tests/fm-task-inbox.test.sh - the per-task steering inbox
# (bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh) and the watcher's re-ring ladder.
#
# The inbox+doorbell design replaces typed steer payloads with durable
# sequenced records acknowledged by an atomic mv into handled/; the terminal
# carries only a constant doorbell line, and the watcher re-rings an
# unacknowledged message before escalating once as an ordinary stale wake.
# These tests pin the semantics with real processes:
#   1. A message is written durably and appears in the inbox, byte-exact
#      including newlines, with a doorbell naming the inbox glob, numeric order,
#      and handled/.
#   2. Sequencing dedups per worker lifetime: the handled mv retires a record,
#      re-acking it is a no-op, and an acknowledged sequence is never reissued.
#      The idempotent enqueue (the remote steer leg's primitive) additionally
#      dedups an exact-body re-run onto the existing record, handled or not.
#   3. Concurrent writers serialize on the sequence lock: no clobbered records.
#   4. The re-ring ladder: within grace is quiet, past grace rings, ring
#      spacing holds, a spent budget escalates exactly once, and an
#      acknowledgement resets the ladder for the next message.
#   5. A real fm-watch.sh subprocess re-rings the doorbell for an unhandled
#      aged message on an idle pane WITHOUT waking firstmate, waits on a busy
#      pane, stays silent on a healthy/empty inbox, surfaces unwritable ladder
#      bookkeeping only while its record remains unhandled, and emits exactly
#      one stale wake once the ring budget is spent.
#   6. Dead panes: the doorbell line is a shell no-op when executed by a bare
#      shell, the ring skips an agent the backend classifies dead, and the
#      watcher surfaces such a record exactly once instead of re-ringing.
#   7. A fire-and-forget record stays outside the ladder, but one whose first
#      ring did not land gets exactly one retry ring and never escalates. The
#      retry waits while the worker has an open decision of its own.
