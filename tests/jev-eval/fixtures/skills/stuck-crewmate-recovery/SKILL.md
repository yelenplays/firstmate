name: stuck-crewmate-recovery
description: >-
  Agent-only playbook for stuck or missing ordinary Firstmate direct reports.
  Use when the session-start digest reports an ordinary direct report's endpoint dead or its metadata has no window, or after a stale wake, looping pane, repeated confusion, an answered-by-brief question, an unresponsive crewmate, or a failed steer.
  Also use on the inverse case: a live crewmate reporting the no-mistakes pipeline dead, unreachable, or timed out.
  Reconciles recorded work before escalating from targeted inspection through safe relaunch or failure.
